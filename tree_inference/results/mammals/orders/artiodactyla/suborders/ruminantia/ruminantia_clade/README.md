The phylogenetic reconstruction of suborder Ruminantia
--------------

This folder structure contains the results of the suborder Ruminantia
performed by [@dimbots](http://github.com/dimbots) using the [SUPERSMART](http://github.com/naturalis/supersmart)
pipeline. Here now follows a brief explanation of the files and the subfolders:

File description:
- `ruminantia_clade.nex` - The complete Ruminantia phylogeny in nexus format.
- `backbone_ruminantia.nex` - The backbone tree of suborder Ruminantia in nexus format.
- `xxx_idmapped.nex`  - A tree that mapped between taxon names and NCBI taxonomy taxon IDs.
- `clade_xxx` - Each directory contains the phylogeny of a Ruminantia family.
