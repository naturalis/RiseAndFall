Tree-comparisons
--------------

This folder structure contains the results of the tree comparison between SUPERSMART, Emmonds, and Faurby trees
performed by [@dimbots](http://github.com/dimbots) using APE functions in R. Here now follows a brief explanation of the files and the subfolders:

File description:
- `emmonds_tree.nex` - The complete mammalian phylogeny of Emmonds et al. 2007.
- `faurby_tree.nex` - The complete mammalian phylogeny of Faurby 2014.
- `supersmart_backbone.nex` - The backbone phylogeny as produced by SUPERSMART.
- `xxx.pdf` - The visual represantation of the related tree comparison.
- `tree-comp-plot.R` - A file that contains an R-script used for the backbones tree comparison.
